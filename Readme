This Python code defines a dictionary records that maps students to their subjects. A function, new_dict, takes the dictionary as input and inverts it, creating a new dictionary where subjects are keys, and the values are lists of students enrolled in each subject. Using loops and conditional checks, the function ensures that each subject has no more than three students. The inverted dictionary is returned and printed for comparison with the original.
